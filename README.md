=============
![](img/logo.png)

Craigslist is an American classified advertisements website with sections devoted to jobs, housing, for sale, items wanted, services, community service, gigs, résumés, and discussion forums.

**Craiglist** [Forum Session](https://forums.craigslist.org/?areaID=157)

#### System Description
Craiglist is one of the rare sites on the interweb where its platform doesn't sell advertisements. The site is purely run for non-profit reasons given to the community, so they are able to enjoy their rights. Most of what Craiglist offer are second hand product listings. Other than that, they have a forum/ thread section, where Users can enjoy a free democratic discussion about anything. Craiglist's system requires a registered account to access its core features.

#### What's Bad About The Existing System
It's obvious to the eyes that Craiglist's user interface isn't pleasing. It's dull, boring, and it seems they don't have a designer to sort it out. Our team has analysed the forum/ thread section activities.
