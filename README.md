#### System Description
Craiglist is one of the rare sites on the interweb where its platform doesn't sell advertisements. The site is purely run for non-profit reasons given to the community, so they are able to enjoy their rights. Most of what Craiglist offer are second hand product listings. Other than that, they have a forum - thread section, where Users can enjoy a free democratic discussion about anything. Craiglist's system requires a registered account to access its core features.
